# Forecasting Financial Markets: Comparing Time Series and Neural Network Models

## Project Background

This project is centred around supporting a strategic evaluation of forecasting techniques within a financial analytics firm. The core objective is to assess whether classical time series models or artificial neural networks are more effective in forecasting market returns and volatility, with the goal of improving the firms' efficiency and forecasting accuracy. The models were applied to major stock indices (FTSE 100, S&P 500) and cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum) using data from 2018 to 2023.

The project compares ARIMA, GARCH, and EGARCH models with an LSTM neural network. Evaluating forecast accuracy across metrics including RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, providing a data-driven recommendation for model selection based on performance, robustness, and asset class characteristics.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- Returns Forecasting Accuracy (ARIMA vs LSTM)
- Volatility Modelling (GARCH vs EGARCH)
- Model Efficiency and Interpretability
- Forecast Performance by Asset Class (Stocks vs Crypto)

## Data Structure & Initial Checks

Data was obtained from Yahoo Finance and includes:

- **FTSE 100** (^FTSE)
- **S&P 500** (^GSPC)
- **Bitcoin** (BTC-USD)
- **Ethereum** (ETH-USD)

Structured tables used in this analysis:

- `closing_prices`: historical close data  
- `returns_log`: log-transformed returns  
- `forecast_results`: performance metrics for each model  
- `model_configurations`: LSTM layer setups and hyperparameters

Each asset had ~1250â€“1800 records. All series were tested for stationarity (ADF test), and returns were log-transformed to meet model assumptions. Missing values are cleaned, and datasets are scaled appropriately for LSTM modeling.

## Executive Summary

The analysis determined that traditional time series models provide more reliable forecasts than LSTM models when working with relatively limited financial time series data. ARIMA outperformed LSTM in returns forecasting across all assets. EGARCH delivered the most accurate volatility forecasts, due to its ability to model asymmetric shocks. Stock indices were generally easier to forecast than cryptocurrencies, producing lower error rates. Therefore, the firm should operate using mostly or solely time series models, ARIMA for returns and EGARCH for volatility, while forecasting for stocks and reducing cryptocurrency volatility exposure.

**Summary of Findings:**

1. **ARIMA achieved the lowest RMSE and MAE** in returns forecasting.
2. **EGARCH consistently outperformed GARCH** in modeling volatility.
3. **Stocks delivered more predictable outcomes** than cryptocurrencies.

## Recommendations

Based on the results, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Use ARIMA** for short- to medium-term return forecasting.
2. **Implement EGARCH** when modeling volatility with asymmetric risks.
3. **Avoid LSTM** unless larger datasets or exogenous features are available.
4. **Prioritize stock indices** over cryptocurrencies for forecast-driven strategies.
5. **Incorporate macroeconomic variables** to improve LSTM generalization.

## Assumptions and Caveats

- Log returns are not actual returns, but were used to normalize variance and enable time series modeling.
- All series were cleaned and tested for stationarity (ADF test).
- LSTM models excluded macroeconomic or sentiment variables.
- Forecasting spanned a consistent window (2018â€“2023) across all assets.
- RMSE, MAE, and MAPE were computed on out-of-sample predictions.
