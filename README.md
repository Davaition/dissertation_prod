# Forecasting Financial Markets: Comparing Time Series and Neural Network Models

## Project Background

As an aspiring Data Analyst, I conducted this project to support a strategic evaluation of forecasting techniques within a financial analytics firm. The core objective was to assess whether classical time series models or artificial neural networks are more effective in forecasting market returns and volatility. The models were applied to major stock indices (FTSE 100, S&P 500) and cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum) using data from 2018 to 2023.

The project compares ARIMA, GARCH, and EGARCH models with an LSTM neural network. It evaluates forecast accuracy across metrics including RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, providing data-driven recommendations for model selection based on performance, robustness, and asset class characteristics.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- Return Forecasting Accuracy (ARIMA vs LSTM)
- Volatility Modelling (GARCH vs EGARCH)
- Model Efficiency and Interpretability
- Forecast Performance by Asset Class (Stocks vs Crypto)

## Data Structure & Initial Checks

Data was obtained from Yahoo Finance and includes:

- **FTSE 100** (^FTSE)
- **S&P 500** (^GSPC)
- **Bitcoin** (BTC-USD)
- **Ethereum** (ETH-USD)

Structured tables used in this analysis:

- `closing_prices`: historical close data  
- `returns_log`: log-transformed returns  
- `forecast_results`: performance metrics for each model  
- `model_configurations`: LSTM layer setups and hyperparameters

Each asset had ~1250â€“1800 records. All series were tested for stationarity (ADF test), and returns were log-transformed to meet model assumptions. Missing values were cleaned and datasets scaled appropriately for LSTM modeling.

## Executive Summary

This analysis determined that traditional time series models provide more reliable forecasts than LSTM models when working with relatively limited financial time series data. ARIMA outperformed LSTM in return forecasting across all assets. EGARCH delivered the most accurate volatility forecasts, due to its ability to model asymmetric shocks. Stock indices were generally easier to forecast than cryptocurrencies, producing lower error rates.

**Summary of Findings:**

1. **ARIMA achieved lowest RMSE and MAE** in return forecasting.
2. **EGARCH consistently outperformed GARCH** in modeling volatility.
3. **Stocks delivered more predictable outcomes** than cryptocurrencies.

- **S&P 500 ARIMA MAPE:** 182.9 | **LSTM MAPE:** 0.132  
- LSTM models exhibited overfitting and weak generalization on test data

### 2. Volatility Forecasting: GARCH vs EGARCH

- **Ethereum EGARCH RMSE:** 0.01081 | **GARCH RMSE:** 0.011  
- **FTSE EGARCH MAE:** 0.00004 (lowest overall)  
- EGARCH captured leverage effects and asymmetry more effectively than GARCH

### 3. Stocks vs Crypto Forecasting

- **S&P 500 EGARCH RMSE:** 0.00007 | **Ethereum EGARCH RMSE:** 0.01081  
- Cryptocurrencies had higher error due to greater volatility and noise

### 4. Model Efficiency and Configuration

- **ARIMA:** Optimized with `auto.arima()` using AIC and MLE  
- **GARCH/EGARCH:** Rolling 4-month forecasts; (1,1) orders  
- **LSTM:** Keras sequential model, time step = 3, dropout (0.2â€“0.9)  
  - Training: 80%, Validation: 10%, Testing: 10%  
  - Loss function: MSE, Optimizer: Adam  
  - Layer setup: LSTM â†’ Dropout â†’ Dense x3

## Recommendations

Based on results, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Use ARIMA** for short- to medium-term return forecasting.
2. **Implement EGARCH** when modeling volatility with asymmetric risks.
3. **Avoid LSTM** unless larger datasets or exogenous features are available.
4. **Prioritize stock indices** over cryptocurrencies for forecast-driven strategies.
5. **Incorporate macroeconomic variables** to improve LSTM generalization.

## Assumptions and Caveats

- Log returns were used to normalize variance and enable time series modeling.
- All series were cleaned and tested for stationarity (ADF test).
- LSTM models excluded macroeconomic or sentiment variables.
- Forecasting spanned a consistent window (2018â€“2023) across all assets.
- RMSE, MAE, and MAPE were computed on out-of-sample predictions.
